                <div class="description-box">Formerly the youngest chief researcher at the [REDACTED] Wing, this sinner
                    possesses higher intelligence compared to most others. We estimate that everyday conversation with
                    this sinner will prove difficult for managers selected by our current screening process. Avoiding
                    communication altogether will pose a risk on its own, however.</div>

                <div class="description-box">The sinner who developed the engine of Mephistopheles, the bus operated by
                    Limbus Company. She claims that there is no one in the City who could rival her library of knowledge
                    and wisdom, and she isn't necessarily wrong. You might find her high and mighty attitude when she
                    allows you to converse with her displeasing, but as seen with how she treats everyone with subtle
                    gestures of arrogance, there is no hope of her parting with it, ever.</div>

                <div class="description-box">There is no sinner that can outmatch this one's level of passion. An avid
                    aficionada of all things Fixer, she adorns herself with a variety of Fixer-related merchandise. They
                    won't affect her performance in combat one way or another, so there is no need for you to restrict
                    her from keeping her decorations. She is deeply immersed in the role of a righteous Fixer, hence the
                    exaggerated mannerisms akin to those of an actor.</div>

                <div class="description-box">As they say, every person has their own creed—and it’s only right to
                    respect it as the Executive Manager. But with some creeds, you will have difficulty in even simply
                    pretending to sympathize. You will have noticed that the sinner in question is a silent chain-smoker
                    whose eyes shine with a euphoric gleam only during battle. She believes that senselessly destroying
                    the enemy's heads is an uncultured act and a step backward for art.</div>

                <div class="info-box">Hong Lu</div>
                <div class="description-box">A sinner who had lived an affluent life before becoming our company's
                    asset. As such, he has a certain admiration for a free life; but occasionally, he may make ignorant
                    and unsavory questions in regards to the food cooked by a certain other sinner or other aspects of
                    the low-lives' lowly culture. This can cause much irritation for the other sinners.</div>

                <div class="info-box">Heathcliff</div>
                <div class="description-box">This sinner prefers to take action rather than wait for logic to dictate
                    his course. His thoughts and feelings are blatantly visible in his demeanor, and he has no intention
                    of hiding them; his brashness may cause headaches (or physical injury leading to a headache) in the
                    process of forming a relationship.</div>

                <div class="description-box">You may be disheartened by the defective state of many of your sinners, but
                    do not worry; this sinner is one of the few who can carry out most missions without much complaint.
                    She is likely to make reasonable judgements, so it is a good idea to start conversations while
                    looking her way if you're seeking sound advice.</div>

                <div class="info-box">Rodion</div>
                <div class="description-box">The unfortunate traits of being Backstreets-born are apparent in this
                    sinner. She loves money, gambling, and betting—so it is advised to pay close attention to her as the
                    manager. She tends to deflect orders with an unimpressive wink or a silly joke; we recommend taking
                    a stern stance at times to remind her that you are her superior. Her mood may be down at irregular
                    intervals.</div>

                <div class="info-box">Sinclair</div>
                <div class="description-box">Even with the volatile nature of human growth around his age taken into
                    consideration, this sinner seems to get particularly startled or frown when spoken to. He isn't used
                    to real combat at the moment, meaning that he may struggle to keep himself together at the sight of
                    something as mild as spilt innards at first. As there may be those with violent tendencies among
                    your crew, we recommend taking an approach focused on positive reinforcement with this sinner.</div>

                <div class="description-box">This sinner could serve as an excellent advisor depending on your
                    capability. However, she also has a meddlesome tendency, so it is recommended to keep her satisfied
                    with short replies of agreement. She is an expert when it comes to tactics and various pearls of
                    wisdom about life, making her advice all the more valuable for your mission. In addition, she
                    possesses a vast knowledge of workshop technologies; you could trust her with simple repairs of the
                    bus.</div>

                <div class="info-box">Gregor</div>
                <div class="description-box">This sinner is relatively easy to handle in terms of personality. However,
                    an upsurge of emotion or a sudden change of environment may cause parts or the whole of his body to
                    transform into insectile (notably akin to a carapace, resembling that of the _________) tissues. If
                    you do not wish to be a rude manager (not that you're obligated to be nice), we recommend keeping
                    your facial expression in check so that your disgust is not visible to him.</div>
