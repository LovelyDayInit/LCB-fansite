            <h3 data-aos="fade-up">
                Limbus Company is the third installment in the acclaimed Project Moon series, serving as a continuation
                of the interconnected narrative established by its previous successors.<br> The game ties
                deeply into the events and themes explored in Lobotomy Corporation and Library of Ruina, building upon
                the world and characters fans have come to love.

                Set in the year 984, Limbus Company picks up six months after the conclusion of<br> Library of
                Ruina. Players are thrust into a dystopian cityscape teeming with danger, intrigue, and mystery, where
                theyâ€™ll uncover the lingering aftermath of previous events while forging their own path. As the story
                unfolds, connections to the earlier games become increasingly evident, rewarding fans of the series with
                layers of rich storytelling and unexpected twists.
